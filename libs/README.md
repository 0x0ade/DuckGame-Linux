# The DuckGame.exe is mono-cil-stripped!
It doesn't contain any code and is only provided to ensure that the "mod" compiles properly out of the box.
The Steam.dll is a copy of my [Steam.dll to Steamworks.NET proxy.](https://github.com/0x0ade/DuckGame-Steamworks.NET)
If any questions arise, don't hesitate to contact me.
